Okapi-BM25 algorithm module which derived from Lingua::JA::TFIDF

Sorry, this module for Japanese only.


OkapiBM25 is ...

    In information retrieval, Okapi BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Sp√§rck Jones, and others.
    
    The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. To set the right context, however, it usually referred to as "Okapi BM25", since the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s, was the first system to implement this function.
    
    BM25, and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent state-of-the-art retrieval functions used in document retrieval, such as Web search.
